There are numerous types of standards in the field of communication. The traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing technical requirements. In view of the characteristics in the field of communication standards, this thesis adopts the LoRA low-rank adaptation method to fine-tune the large language model to enhance its semantic analysis ability for professional language understanding and targeted content generation. A well-designed ontology structure was proposed. With the assistance of a large language model, efficient recognition and extraction of entities and relations were carried out to construct a knowledge graph of the communication standard domain with high accuracy. The RAG intelligent consultation and question-answering system for retrieval enhancement generation was designed to achieve the organic integration of the fine-tuning model and the knowledge graph. The experimental results show that after fine-tuning on the dataset of 6,587 question-answer pairs in the field of communication standards constructed in this thesis, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the field of communication standards on the test set. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 12,361 relations was constructed, demonstrating good accuracy. The intelligent consultation and question-answering system, combining web services and API interfaces, has achieved good results in terms of the accuracy of knowledge retrieval, the response speed of question-answering, and the user interaction experience, and has good practical application value.
