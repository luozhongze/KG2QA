The rapid evolution of communication technologies has led to an explosion of standards, rendering traditional expert-dependent consultation methods inefficient and slow. To address this challenge, we propose **KG2QA**, an intelligent question-answering system for communication standards that integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We construct a high-quality dataset of 6,587 QA pairs from ITU-T recommendations and fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, achieving significant performance gains: BLEU-4 increases from 18.86 to 66.90, outperforming both the base model and Llama-3-8B-Instruct. A structured KG containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations is built using LLM-assisted triple extraction based on a custom ontology. In our RAG pipeline, the fine-tuned LLM first retrieves relevant knowledge from the KG, enabling more accurate and factually grounded responses. Evaluated by DeepSeek-V3 as a judge, the KG-enhanced system improves performance across five dimensions, with an average score increase of 2.26\%, demonstrating superior factual accuracy and relevance. Integrated with Web platform and API, KG2QA delivers an efficient and interactive user experience. Our code and data have been open-sourced.

This dataset can be used for fine-tuning large language models in the field of communication standards. The data is sourced from `ITU-T Recommendations` and the language is English. You can click [here](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/publications/Pages/recs.aspx) to visit the ITU-T official website and view the source file.

The dataset is divided into the training set and the test set. The training set is composed of data of the three categories of `G, V, X`, all of which are saved in `JSON`, and the test set is `test.json`.

The dataset was obtained by QA extraction of the source file PDF using the `Deepseek V3 API`, and the data volume is as follows.

288 PDF source files are stored in the `G, V, X` folders corresponding to their category sources.

| Category | Quantity of QA |
| :----: | :--: |
| G.json | 898 |
| V.json | 1,101 |
| X.json | 3,779 |
| test.json | 809 |
| All Categories | 6,587 |

The data is derived from ITU-T Recommendations and is taken from three series of recommendations. A total of `288 PDF source files` were selected for QA construction in the three series. The specific category sources are as follows.

### View the ontology on Protege

Ontology are saved in the ``kg`` folder. After opening ``Protege.exe``, click File-Open and select ``on.rdf`` to open it

### View the knowledge graph on Neo4j

1. Node and relationship data are saved in the ``import`` folder in CSV UTF-8 format. Save this folder in the local Neo4j path, and then ForPKG can be stored and displayed.

```
D:\neo4j-community-5.18.1\import
```

2. Restart neo4j
On the computer, type ``cmd`` to enter the command line. Go to ``neo4j-community-4.3.18\bin``, type ``neo4j restart`` to restart neo4j. In the browser, type ``localhost:7474/browser/`` to enter neo4j.

```
cd D:\neo4j-community-5.18.1\bin
neo4j restart
```

3. Click the database icon and click ``:dbs`` of DBMS

### Explanation

#### Neo4j

```
1. Import a specific entity type
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///file_name.csv' AS line # file_name represents a specific entity type, and file_name.csv is the CSV file for that entity type  
MERGE (:file_name { ID: line.ID, name: line.name, LABEL: line.LABEL })

2. Delete a specific entity type  
MATCH (r:`file_name`) DETACH DELETE r  // file_name represents a specific entity type  

3. Create all relationships  
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///roles.csv' AS row  // roles.csv is the CSV file containing all relationships  
MATCH (fromNode {ID: row.from}), (toNode {ID: row.to})  
CALL apoc.create.relationship(fromNode, row.relation, {}, toNode) YIELD rel  
RETURN rel  

4. Delete a specific relationship  
MATCH ()-[r:duty]-() DETACH DELETE r  

5. Delete all relationships  
MATCH ()-[r]-() DETACH DELETE r  

6. Display all entities and relationships  
MATCH (n) RETURN n
